# SBOXU

To use this software, you first need to compile the content of the
sboxU folder. To this end, you need `cmake` (see
https://cmake.org/). It is achieved by running the following commands
in the folder `sboxU`:

    cmake .
    make
    
Then, in order to use this function, simply paste/make a link to the
folder sboxU from the directory in which you are working. For example,
if you have a script called `test.py` in which you want to call the
functions in sboxU then your directory should look like this:

    $ ls
    test.py
    sboxu/
    
and the file `test.py` should contain `from sboxU import *`.
