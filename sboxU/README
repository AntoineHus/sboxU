# SBOXU

To use this software, you first need to compile the content of the
sboxU/sboxU_cython folder. This process only relies on SAGE, however,
you need a recent version of it (it works with SAGE 9.3). To compile
it:

    cd sboxU/sboxU_cython
    sage setup.py build_ext --inplace
    
Then, in order to use the functions provided by sboxU, simply
paste/make a link to the folder sboxU from the directory in which you
are working. For example, if you have a script called `test.py` in
which you want to call the functions in sboxU then your directory
should look like this:

    $ ls
    test.py
    sboxu/
    
and the file `test.py` should contain `from sboxU import *`. You can
also import sboxU in a sage notebook session provided that you started
sage from the folder containing it.
