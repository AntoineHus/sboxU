# SboxU v1.0

## Description

SAGE/Python functions useful for studying S-boxes and Boolean
functions such as computing the DDT, computing the Walsh spectrum,
affine equivalence testing... Some of them are implemented in C++
and/or in parallel to improve their performances.


## Dependencies

`sboxU` only depends on a recent version of SAGE (it was tested with
version 9.3).


## Usage

To retrieve this module, use the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/lpp-crypto/sboxU/

Then, you need to compile the content of the `sboxU/sboxU_cython` folder.
This process only relies on SAGE To compile it:

    cd sboxU/sboxU_cython
    sage setup.py build_ext --inplace

This compiles the C++ part of `sboxU` and allows it to be called from
a SAGE script. To use it in your project, simply move the `sboxU`
folder to your project's directory. You can then import `sboxU` like
any other python module.  As an example of the functions provided by
`sboxU`, the SAGE script `example.py` stored alongside the folder
`sboxU` generates random permutations and tests their affine
equivalence.
    
Then, in order to use the functions provided by sboxU, simply
paste/make a link to the folder sboxU from the directory in which you
are working. For example, if you have a script called `test.py` in
which you want to call the functions in sboxU then your directory
should look like this:

    $ ls
    test.py
    README.md
    sboxu/
    
and the file `test.py` should contain `from sboxU import *`. You can
also import sboxU in a sage notebook session provided that you started
sage from the folder containing it.


## Troubleshooting

- `undefined symbol: _Py_ZeroStruct` If you get such an error, there
  are probably mismatches between the python versions used. This
  typically happens if you have 2 versions of SAGE installed, used the
  most recent one to compile `sboxU`, but then use an older one in
  your scripts.
